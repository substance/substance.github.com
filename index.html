      <h3>Stencila</h3>
      <a href="http://stenci.la">Stencila</a> is a platform for creating documents that are driven by data. Stencila Stencils are much like traditional templates for embedding data analysis and presentation code but designed to also play friendly with WYSIWYG editing - think RMarkdown meets Jade meets Google Docs. <a href="https://stenci.la/stencila/blog/introducing-sheets/spreadsheets-are-dead-long-live-reactive-programming-environments-">Stencila Sheets</a> are much like traditional spreadsheets but with cells that are expressions in the host language (i.e. R or Python or ...) and with a bunch of other characteristics that make them fit in with modern software practices - think R meets Google Sheets meets git.

      <h3>Lens</h3>
      Together with <a href="http://elifesciences.org">eLife</a>, Substance is developing <strong>Lens</strong>, an open source toolkit around scientific content. In June 2013 eLife launched the original <a href="http://elifesciences.org/elife-news/lens">Lens Reader</a>, which provides a novel way of looking at content on the web. <a href="https://medium.com/@_mql/self-host-a-scientific-journal-with-elife-lens-f420afb678aa">Lens Browser</a> and <a href="http://substance.io/lens">Lens Writer</a> followed in 2015 complementing the Lens ecosystem.

      <h3>Archivist</h3>
      <a href="https://medium.com/@_daniel/publish-interactive-historical-documents-with-archivist-7019f6408ee6">Archivist</a> is a new platform used by researchers at <a href="http://www.memorial.de/index.php?id=18" target="_blank">International Society Memorial</a>. They are creating an archive of interview transcriptions related to the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ost-Arbeiter" target="_blank">Ost-Arbeiters</a> and WWII POWs. Using Archivist they associate words and passages with an ontology of subject terms, locations, persons and definitions. Later they are able to examine that data and find relevant text passages easily.
