      <h3>Archivist</h3>
      <a href="https://medium.com/@_daniel/publish-interactive-historical-documents-with-archivist-7019f6408ee6">Archivist</a> is a new platform used by researchers at <a href="http://www.memorial.de/index.php?id=18" target="_blank">International Society Memorial</a>. They are creating an archive of interview transcriptions related to the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ost-Arbeiter" target="_blank">Ost-Arbeiters</a> and WWII POWs. Using Archivist they associate words and passages with an ontology of subject terms, locations, persons and definitions. Later they are able to examine that data and find relevant text passages easily.
