      <h2>Operation based manipulation</h2>
      <p>Substance documents are manipulated with operations that can be undone, redone and distributed over a network for concurrent manipulations (collaborative editing)</p>
      <h2>HTML/XML import export</h2>
      <p>Substance interacts well with HTML/XML content. E.g. you can import whole XML documents or insert HTML fragments from the clipboard.</p>
      <h2>Server and client-side execution</h2>
      <p>Substance runs in the browser and server-side environments, such as Node.js or io.js.</p>
